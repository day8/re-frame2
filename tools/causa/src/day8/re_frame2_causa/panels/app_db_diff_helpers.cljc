  "Pure-data helpers for Causa's App-DB Diff panel (Phase 5, rf2-jps1o).

  ## Why a separate `.cljc` ns

  The panel view in `app_db_diff.cljs` touches DOM event handlers
  (right-click affordances, pin buttons). The *logic* — the
  structural-sharing diff, the reserved-keys partitioning, the pin-
  store transitions, the 'Show me when this changed' walker — is
  pure data → data. Splitting that logic into `.cljc` so it runs
  under the JVM unit-test target (`clojure -M:test`) is required by
  the standing rule `feedback_jvm_interop_must_work.md`.

  ## Diff algorithm — `diff-paths`

  Per spec/004-App-DB-Diff.md §Changed-paths derivation the diff is
  **structural-sharing**:

    - **Map-pointer-equality at each level.** When two sub-maps are
      `identical?` the subtree is unchanged; skip.
    - **Recurse only where pointers differ.** O(changed paths), not
      O(db size).
    - **Emit a sorted vector of `{:op :path :before :after}`** triples
      where `:op` is `:added` / `:modified` / `:removed`.

  `identical?` is the same predicate `clojure.core` uses for pointer
  equality. On the JVM it's `==` over object references; in CLJS
  it's `===`. PersistentHashMap instances produced by `assoc-in`
  share structure with their predecessors — every untouched sub-map
  is `identical?` to the predecessor's sub-map at the same path.

  ## Reserved-keys partition — `partition-reserved`

  Per spec §Reserved-keys group the runtime owns five top-level keys
  (`:rf/machines`, `:rf/route`, `:rf/system-ids`,
  `:rf/pending-navigation`, `:rf/spawned`). The diff triples for
  those keys render in a separate `[runtime]` group; the rest render
  as slice mini-panels.

  ## Pin store — `pin-path` / `unpin-path` / `reorder-paths`

  The pin store is per-frame: `{frame-id [path-1 path-2 ...]}`. Order
  preserved by vector. Pins are paths (vectors of keys), not values —
  the live value derefs against the current target-frame on each
  recompute (per spec §Performance — O(pins) per epoch, not O(db)).

  ## 'Show me when this changed' — `epochs-touching-path`

  Walks the epoch-history, diffing each epoch's `:db-before` and
  `:db-after` and filtering to those that touched the focused path.
  Pure data → vector of hit maps. Per spec §'Show me when this
  changed'."
  (:require [clojure.set :as set]))

;; ---- reserved keys --------------------------------------------------------

(def reserved-app-db-keys
  "Per spec/Conventions.md §Reserved app-db keys the runtime owns six
  top-level slots in `app-db`. Diff triples whose path roots in one
  of these keys render in the `[runtime]` group rather than as a
  slice mini-panel.

  - `:rf/machines` — machine snapshots (per spec/005-StateMachines.md)
  - `:rf/system-ids` — system-id reverse index
  - `:rf/route` — current route slice (per spec/012-Routing.md)
  - `:rf/pending-navigation` — pending-nav slot
  - `:rf/spawned` — spawned-actor table
  - `:rf/elision` — wire-elision declaration registry (per spec/009-Instrumentation.md §Size elision)

  Lockstep contract: this set MUST match the rows of
  spec/Conventions.md §Reserved app-db keys exactly. The drift-detector
  test `reserved-app-db-keys-matches-conventions-md` in
  `app_db_diff_helpers_cljs_test.cljc` enforces the invariant."

  (boolean (and (sequential? path)
                (seq path)
                (contains? reserved-app-db-keys (first path)))))

;; ---- diff algorithm -------------------------------------------------------

(defn- map-like?
  "True when `x` is a map. Recursion-friendly — only walks into nested
  maps; vectors / lists / sets are leaf values for diff purposes (per
  spec §Changed-paths derivation — the diff bottoms out at the first
  non-map level, so a slice's `before` / `after` is the whole nested
  value)."
  [x]
  (map? x))

(defn diff-paths
  "Diff two app-db values. Returns a vector of triples:

      [{:op :added    :path [:k1 :k2 ...] :before nil      :after v}
       {:op :modified :path [:k1 :k2 ...] :before v-old    :after v-new}
       {:op :removed  :path [:k1 :k2 ...] :before v        :after nil}
       ...]

  Triples are sorted by path-as-pr-str so the order is stable across
  re-renders (the spec doesn't dictate an order; lexical-by-path is
  the obvious choice and gives consistent test snapshots).

  ## Structural sharing

  When `before` and `after` are both maps and have `identical?` keys
  at level N, that subtree is skipped — pure pointer-equality short-
  circuit. This is the O(changed paths) guarantee per spec §Changed-
  paths derivation.

  ## Per-key diff classification

    - `(contains? after k)` and not `(contains? before k)` → `:added`
    - not `(contains? after k)` and `(contains? before k)` → `:removed`
    - both contain k:
      - `identical?` values → no diff (structural-sharing short-circuit)
      - both maps, not `identical?` → recurse with extended path
      - otherwise (one or both non-map; not identical) → `:modified`
        leaf at this path

  Non-map sub-trees (e.g., a vector slice that changed from `[a b]`
  to `[a b c]`) are emitted as a single `:modified` triple at the
  parent path — the slice mini-panel's `before` / `after` shows the
  whole nested value side-by-side.

  Pure data → data. JVM-runnable."
