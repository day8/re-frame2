(ns day8.re-frame2-xray.test-helpers.host-fixtures.deep-machine
  "Headless host fixture exercising a real machine — narrowed from the
  full `testbeds/deep_machine/core.cljs` to two states + one
  transition. The point of this fixture is to drive a real
  `:rf.machine/transition` trace event through the framework's
  machines plumbing, so Xray's Machine Inspector + Machines tab subs
  have real data to project.

  ## Why the narrow surface

  The full deep-machine testbed declares parallel regions,
  hierarchical compound 5-deep, `:always`, `:after`, `:spawn`,
  `:spawn-all` — every Spec 005 grammar surface. That's important
  for visual diff coverage; for the e2e helper's bug-catching
  contract (does the `:frame` tag survive into Xray's epoch
  capture?) a single flat transition is enough.

  Tests that need richer machine grammar should add a sibling
  fixture (e.g. `deep-machine-full/install!`) once the e2e harness
  proves out on this narrower surface.

  ## Bug class this catches

  rf2-hwuki — `:rf.machine/transition` emit dropped the `:frame`
  tag, which meant Xray's epoch-capture filter rejected the event
  (no `:frame` → can't route into any frame's epoch ring), and the
  Machine Inspector panel stayed empty even after a real machine
  transition fired. With this fixture installed in the host and
  Xray subscribed to `:rf.xray/machine-snapshots`, a real
  `[:deep/main [:work/go]]` dispatch into the host MUST appear in
  Xray's snapshot map — if it doesn't, the bug is back."
