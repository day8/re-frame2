(ns re-frame.story-share-cljs-test
  "CLJS smoke tests for the per-variant share URL builder. The pure URL
  logic in .cljc is JVM-tested in `re-frame.story-share-test`; this
  ns covers CLJS-specific paths (the `js/encodeURIComponent` path).

  The share URL is the same URL the browser's address bar carries —
  there is no separate Share button or QR popover (rf2-ymnfx Issue B
  removed the redundant affordance). The URL builder remains because
  `re-frame.story.ui.url-state` writes it via `pushState` and the
  public `story/variant-share-url` facade is exported for embed code
  (per `tools/story/spec/Tutorial-Embed.md`)."
