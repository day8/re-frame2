(ns re-frame.story.schemas
  "Malli schemas for the Story authoring surface.

  These schemas are the structural contract for what `reg-story`,
  `reg-variant`, `reg-workspace`, `reg-mode`, `reg-story-panel`,
  `reg-decorator` and `reg-tag` will accept. Per IMPL-SPEC §13.2 #3
  the `reg-decorator` per-kind body schemas are defined here.

  The schemas enforce:

  - **EDN-first variant bodies** (IMPL-SPEC §2.6, Phase-2 §5.1 #10).
    Every variant key is data — vectors / maps / keywords / strings /
    numbers / sets. No fn-valued slots. The closure caveat (a decorator's
    `:wrap` is a fn) applies at the *decorator registration site*, not the
    variant body.

  - **Canonical id grammar** (spec/007 §Canonical id grammar). Story ids
    live under the `:story.<path>` namespace; variant ids extend the story
    id with `/<name>`; workspace ids live under `:Workspace.<path>/<name>`;
    mode ids live under `:Mode.<path>/<name>`. Per Conventions.md the
    `:rf/*` framework prefix stays clear for the framework; Story's
    prefixes are library-owned.

  - **Tag set membership** is validated at registration time (see
    `re-frame.story.registrar`) — the schema accepts any keyword set; the
    registrar cross-checks against `:rf.error/unknown-tag`.

  Schemas are plain Malli forms — see `metosin/malli`. They run on both
  JVM and CLJS. The `:rf/variant` schema cross-references spec/007
  §Variant artefact contract.

  ## Where the schemas are used

  - `re-frame.story.registrar/reg-variant*` and siblings validate their
    incoming body against the matching schema and reject with structured
    `:rf.error/<artefact>-shape` on a miss.
  - JVM tests in `tools/story/test/` round-trip example bodies through
    these schemas.

  ## Elision contract

  The schemas themselves are plain data and survive `:advanced` builds.
  But all consumers (the registrar entry points) elide their entire
  validation branch under `goog.DEBUG=false` via the same sentinel
  pattern Spec 009 locks for instrumentation."

  - `:status` → `#{:alpha :beta :stable :deprecated}` — release maturity.

  Two axes are user-extensible (no canonical enum):

  - `:feature` — feature / product area.

  The recommended vocabularies are NOT enforced by the schema —
  `:status` may carry any keyword the project registers. They exist as
  a discoverable convention so multiple projects converge on the same
  shape without further coordination.

  The preferred faceted-tag shape is the namespaced keyword:
  `:status/alpha`, `:role/dev`, `:team/checkout`, `:feature/payment` —

  All slots are optional. The preset is plain data; the runtime side
  (`re-frame.story.causa-preset`) feature-detects Causa and the optional
  filters API, no-opping gracefully when absent.

  - `:open?`   — when truthy, auto-open the Causa shell on variant mount.
                 Under the per-panel embed (rf2-v1ach) this is largely
                 superseded by `:panel` — the chip-row + selected panel
                 are the default RHS surface; `:open?` survives for the
                 popout / whole-shell escape hatch only.
  - `:panel`   — rf2-v1ach. The Causa panel to mount in the RHS Causa
                 host. One of:
                   `:event-detail` (default)

                 Authors choose the panel-id that fits the story's

                 `:routing-demo/*` → `:routing`, etc.). The user can
                 swap at runtime via the RHS chip-row; the user's
                 manual click overrides for the session.
  - `:tab`     — DEPRECATED in v1. Was the Causa full-shell tab-id;
                 pre-rf2-v1ach the RHS hosted the full 4-layer shell
                 and `:tab` pre-focused a panel inside it. Under the
                 per-panel embed the chip-row is the panel selector;
                 `:panel` carries the same intent. `:tab` still
                 accepted by the preset runtime for back-compat with
                 the popout escape hatch but new authors should use
                 `:panel`.
  - `:filters` — `{:out [event-id ...] :in [event-id ...]}` — Causa
                 auto-filter pills to pre-populate. Both axes are
                 optional. Skipped with a console warning when
                 `day8.re-frame2-causa.filters` (rf2-ak4ms) is not on
                 the classpath.
  - `:focus`   — optional pre-focus coordinates. `{:event-pos N}` selects
                 the Nth event in the current cascade. Rare; usually you
                 want LIVE to track head."

  mounts its cells. `:isolated` (the default) mounts every variant
  cell in parallel, each scoped to its own variant frame — the
  baseline frame-isolation contract. `:shared` mounts ONE cell at a
  time with a prev/next navigator, serialising the renderer. This is
  the load-bearing affordance for views that internally hardcode a
  frame-provider (the rf2-sszlr / `gallery_chrome.cljs` pattern):
  parallel cells of such views share their interior state because the
  last-seeded cell's app-db clobbers the others. Only honoured by
  `:variants-grid`; ignored on other layouts."
