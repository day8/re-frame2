(ns re-frame.late-bind-missing-test
  "Per rf2-5b6x — assert the documented missing-artefact error contract for
  the routing artefact's `re-frame.core` re-exports.

  Each per-feature split (schemas / machines / routing / flows / http /
  ssr) raises a documented `:rf.error/<artefact>-artefact-missing`
  ex-info when a consumer calls a re-exported surface but the artefact
  is absent from the classpath. The contract was previously only
  documented in prose; this test pins the runtime behaviour against
  regression.

  Strategy: the routing artefact IS on the classpath here (the test ns
  requires `re-frame.routing`, which fires the late-bind hook
  registrations at ns-load). To simulate the absent-artefact state we
  flip the relevant late-bind hook to nil for the duration of the
  assertion, then restore it in `finally`. Identical mechanism as the
  test would use on CLJS.

  Per Spec 002 §The late-bind seam, rf2-k682 (routing split), and the
  prose at the call sites in `re-frame.core`.

  Note (rf2-wad2fl — front-porch shrink): the URL-codec fns `match-url` /
  `route-url` (and `current-url` / `clear-route`) were demoted off the
  `re-frame.core` façade — they are reached through `re-frame.routing`
  now, so the façade artefact-missing contract no longer applies to them.
  The façade surfaces that remain are the `reg-route` registration MACRO
  (source-coord capture) and `route-link` (no owned-ns peer); their
  missing-artefact contracts are tested below."
