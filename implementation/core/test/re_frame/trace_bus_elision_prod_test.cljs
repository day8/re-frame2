  "Per Spec 009 §Production builds (bead rf2-l7hlm) — `:advanced` +
  `goog.DEBUG=false` runtime contract for the `re-frame.trace.tooling`
  RING BUFFER (the 'trace bus'). Companion to
  `re-frame.trace-listener-elision-prod-test` (rf2-2zdu) which covers
  the listener fan-out side of the trace surface; this file pins the
  buffer side.

  Under prod-mode the buffer surface's bodies all sit inside `(when
  interop/debug-enabled? ...)` — `configure-trace-buffer!` /
  `clear-trace-buffer!` no-op silently; `trace-buffer` returns nil
  rather than the buffer vector. The defonce'd atom itself remains
  (it's a value-layer artefact, not gated), but no caller can populate
  it because every push site sits inside the gated `deliver!` /
  `emit!` chain.

  Per Spec 009 §Retain-N trace ring buffer (rf2-smee): the buffer is a
  dev-only inspection surface. Production observability rides the
  always-on event-emit / error-emit substrates instead.

  Naming convention: files ending in `-elision-prod-test.cljs` are
  picked up ONLY by the `:browser-test-prod-elision` build. Running
  this file under `goog.DEBUG=true` would FAIL by design — under dev
  the buffer accumulates events as designed."
