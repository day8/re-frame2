(ns re-frame.api-manifest.api-md-check-test
  "Regression tests for the spec/API.md projection check's qualifier
  resolution (rf2-41j0a).

  THE BUG. The API.md var-row validator stripped any namespace/alias
  qualifier from the documented var name and matched by BARE var name only;
  the manifest lookup was also keyed by bare var. The manifest carries the
  SAME bare var `adapter` for FOUR distinct namespaces
  (`re-frame.adapter.{reagent,uix,helix}` at tier `:adapter`, plus
  `re-frame.ssr` at `:internal-public`). So a QUALIFIED row such as
  `uix-adapter/adapter` could drift to a stale / wrong / unknown qualifier
  (`bogus-adapter/adapter`) and STILL pass, because some other manifest
  entry with bare name `adapter` carried the expected tier — a false-green
  drift gate.

  THE FIX. Qualified rows resolve STRICTLY against the manifest
  `[namespace var]` index: the qualifier is mapped through the documented
  adapter `:as` aliases (`adapter-aliases`) else taken verbatim (the
  full-namespace `re-frame.http/...` rows ARE literal manifest
  namespaces), and the resolved `[namespace var]` pair must exist with a
  matching tier. Bare rows keep the original by-bare-name latitude + the
  bare-name allowlist. These tests pin that contract through the pure
  `reconcile` reconciler with synthetic inputs, plus a live smoke that the
  committed spec/API.md + manifest still reconcile clean."
