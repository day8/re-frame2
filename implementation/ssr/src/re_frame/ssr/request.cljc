  "Per-request request slot + the `:rf.server/request` cofx + the
  per-request frame-teardown hook. Per Spec 011 §Server-only `reg-cofx`
  for request context and §Per-request frame teardown contract (rf2-fcj33).

  The `:rf.server/request` cofx surfaces the active HTTP request map to
  event handlers via `(rf/inject-cofx :rf.server/request)`. Use cases:
  reading the URL inside `:rf/server-init`, pulling a session cookie in
  `:auth/check-session`, branching on `:request-method`, etc.

  The mechanism is a per-frame slot — NOT a single dynamic var — so two
  simultaneous per-request frames (the common SSR shape under concurrent
  load) carry independent request data without leaking into each other.
  Host adapters (rf2-ny6v7's Ring adapter; future Pedestal / raw-HTTP /
  edge-runtime adapters) populate the slot via `set-request!` before
  kicking off the drain and clear it via `clear-request!` after the
  response is built (typically inside `frame.cljc`'s `destroy-frame!`
  teardown — but adapters that re-use a long-lived frame can clear
  inline).

  Storage shape: `defonce` side-channel atom keyed by frame-id. This
  mirrors `pending-error-traces` rather than living in app-db because
  the request map is HOST-CONTROLLED INPUT (the host's wire-shape data —
  Ring request map, Pedestal context, etc.); the cofx surfaces it into
  the handler's `:coeffects` map, but it has no place in the
  application's serialisable app-db. Storing it outside app-db keeps it
  out of the hydration payload (`:rf/app-db` ships to the client) —
  server-side request data must never leak into the client's bootstrap
  state.

  The cofx is `:platforms #{:server}` so client-side dispatches that
  reference it silently no-op via `:rf.cofx/skipped-on-platform` (the
  standard cofx-gating contract per Spec 011 §634-642).

  The `reg-cofx` registration for `:rf.server/request` lives in the
  `re-frame.ssr` façade so a `(require 're-frame.ssr :reload)` after
  `(registrar/clear-all!)` re-installs it. This namespace exports the
  handler fn only.

  Per the rf2-gxgo7 split of re-frame.ssr."

;; ---- per-request frame teardown (rf2-fcj33) -------------------------------
;;
;; Per Spec 011 §Per-request frame teardown contract. The SSR runtime owns
;; two side-channel `defonce` atoms keyed by frame-id — `pending-error-
;; traces` (per-frame buffer of captured error trace events, in
;; `re-frame.ssr.error-projector`) and `request-slots` (per-frame
;; HTTP-request map, here). Both live outside app-db (see the rationale
;; comments above each defonce) and so are NOT cleared by the frame's
;; app-db / sub-cache teardown in `frame/destroy-frame!`.
;;
;; This fn is the cleanup hook. Wired into `frame/destroy-frame!` via the
;; `:ssr/on-frame-destroyed` late-bind key — `core` calls it from its
;; ordered teardown step list when the SSR artefact is on the classpath;
;; the hook resolves to nil and the destroy proceeds without it when the
;; SSR artefact is absent. Idempotent: tolerates a frame-id with no slot
;; in either atom.
