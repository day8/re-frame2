(ns re-frame.machines-conformance-test
  "Per rf2-d0wem (and rf2-ra1he §TE5). Drives every conformance-corpus
  fixture whose `:fixture/calls` exercise `:machine-transition`
  through `re-frame.machines/machine-transition` and `=`-checks the
  result against the recorded `:expect-next-snapshot` /
  `:expect-effects`.

  The conformance corpus at `spec/conformance/fixtures/*.edn` is the
  normative behaviour description for `machine-transition`. Pre-rf2-d0wem
  only the core artefact's `re-frame.conformance-test` ran the corpus.
  This namespace wires the machine-related Mode B fixtures into the
  machines artefact's own CI gate, so the spec-defined invariants run
  on every machines-touching PR (and any machines refactor that breaks a
  fixture surfaces at the machines artefact's gate rather than only
  downstream at core's).

  Scope:
    - Mode B fixtures only — `:fixture/calls` containing
      `:call :machine-transition`. Mode A (dispatch-driven) fixtures
      live downstream in the core artefact's runner, which has the
      frame + dispatch loop.
    - Pure-function assertions only — `:expect-next-snapshot` and
      `:expect-effects` per `spec/conformance/README.md` §Mode B.
    - No side-effects, no frame, no app-db. The machines artefact's
      transition engine is JVM-runnable from arguments alone.

  Capability tagging:
    The conformance README §Capability tagging says conformance is
    graded against the port's claimed capability list. For this Mode B
    runner the practical capability set is everything the
    `machine-transition` primitive covers — :fsm/flat, :fsm/hierarchical,
    :fsm/parallel-regions, :fsm/eventless-always, :fsm/delayed-after,
    :fsm/tags, :fsm/final-states, plus :actor/spawn-destroy and
    :actor/invoke (both surface as spawn/destroy fx in the result
    vector, no live actor needed). Anything else (e.g. :core/error,
    :routing/*, :ssr/*) is core's surface and the fixture is skipped.

  This is a per-artefact gate; the core artefact's runner exercises the
  full corpus end-to-end through the dispatch loop. Both gates running
  is intentional belt-and-braces."
